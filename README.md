# React Shop App

React Shop App is a shopping application that divides content into pages for better navigation. The cart is managed using React Context with useReducer, which also saves the state in localStorage and synchronizes across tabs. All of the data is fetched from the Fake Store API. The app is fully responsive and designed to provide a seamless shopping experience.
